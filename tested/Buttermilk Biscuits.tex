\section*{Buttermilk Biscuits}



\subsection*{Ingredients}
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour\\
$\slfrac{1}{4}$ tsp baking soda\\
1 tbsp baking powder\\
1 $\slfrac{1}{4}$ tsp salt\\
6 tbsp unsalted butter, very cold\\
1 cup buttermilk\\

\subsection*{Directions}
\begin{list}{\arabic{qcounter}:~}{\usecounter{qcounter}}

\item Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
\item Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, or in the bowl of a food processor.
\item Cut the butter into chunks and cut into the flour until it resembles coarse meal.
\item Add the buttermilk and mix until just combined. Dough should be quite wet.
\item Turn the dough out onto a floured board.
\item Gently pat or roll the dough out until about $\frac{1}{2}$ inch thick.  Fold the dough and repeat about 5 times.
\item Cut the dough into rounds.
\item Place the biscuits on a cookie sheet about 1 inch apart.
\item Bake for about 10-12 minutes.
\end{list}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Be careful not to overwork the dough when rolling it out. If you do, you'll get hockey pucks instead of biscuits.
\end{itemize}
