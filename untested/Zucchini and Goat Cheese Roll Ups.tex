3 oz goat cheese, at room temperature\\
1 tablespoon finely chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, well drained\\

\begin{list}{\arabic{qcounter}:~}{\usecounter{qcounter}}
\item Heat a grill to high heat.
\item Grill the zucchini strips until well browned and limp (3 to 4 minutes per side).
\item When done, drape them over a cooling rack to prevent them from steaming as they cool.
\item Combine the goat cheese, tomatoes, oil, thyme, and $\slfrac{1}{2}$ teaspoon of salt.
\item Spread a heaping teaspoon of the filling thinly over one side of each grilled zucchini strip.
\item Roll up the zucchini (not too tightly) and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment or foil.
\item Sprinkle each roll with a little of the grated Parmigiano and broil until brown, about 1 minute.
